#### Modern day Social Advantages and Disadvantages as a result of the Advancement of Information Technology
Computers have grown to be a part of everyday life and do provide undeniable advantages to society; however, have there been any disadvantages due to the advancement in computers throughout history and perhaps in the future? Perspectives must be taken into consideration when discussing the advancement of technology. Sure, new inventions are most commonly seen as beneficial, but perhaps an invention costs someone their job. Would the advancement still be considered beneficial, or even be considered an advancement? If someone lost their job to new technology, it did not advance the now unemployed person. Perhaps someone has their credit cards electronically in their phone to use apple pay or Samsung pay. This is considered to be a hot wallet. If the phone is lost or stolen, the person who takes possession of the phone is now presented with an opportunity to financially harm the phones rightful owner. Risks of technological advancements must be assessed to determine if it is truly an advantage or disadvantage to society.

#### An Example of jobs being made obsolete by computers
As computers become more advanced, society is discovering that jobs, originally done by humans for an hourly wage, can be replaced by a computer which will eventually save the company money. For example, grocery stores are eliminating cashier positions and installing self-checkouts. The elimination of people saves, eventually saves the company money by not having to pay salaries. A company that recently did this was Costco. Costco removed 2 registers (4 employees, 2 per register), and added six self-checkouts which only requires one of two employees. Costco expects 40% of the business to go through these self-checkout terminals. However, this example is a little one sided in favor of the company as someone’s career is now ended, because of computer advancements. Viewing technological advancements through different perspectives will present advantages as well as disadvantages, if there are any to be recognized. I would like to provide detailed research and different perspectives on how modern advancements in computers have affected the following:

•	Jobs now becoming obsolete
•	The auto industry, specifically the advancement of computer systems in cars
•	Education and the effect the advancement of technology has on students
•	Businesses and how technological advancements have been beneficial and detrimental

It is important to understand these situations, consider the different perspective and take them into consideration when searching for a career the IT industry. It is important to analyze each possible outcome of technological advancements, and their effects, prior to implementing them. Advancements in IT are changing the world, however this ought to be done in a way that is mutually beneficial for all who will be affected by it.


### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.
