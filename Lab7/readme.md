## Executive Summary 
Software engineering is the process of developing software through following the SDLC (System Development Life Sycle) and the use of programming languages. The SDLC is broken down into steps of creating and maintaining a program including, methodologies, which describe different strategies to creating a program. Programming languages are categorized into generations. It is important to select the proper language for the program that is being created. After the language is selected, the programmer uses that language to create a logical set of instructions for the computer. Languages are either compiled or interpreted. Compiled languages a translated into a machine-readable for to be executed by the computer (c, c++, c#). An interpreted language requires a runtime program in order to execute the code.
	Programming can be procedural or object-oriented. Procedural is designed to allow a programmer to define a specific starting point for the program and then execute it sequentially. Object-oriented programming is set up so that the programmer defines “objects” that can take certain actions based on input from the programmer. UMLs, unified modeling language, is a chart that almost designs and maps out the code for the programmer. Programs are developed in IDEs, and integrated development environment. The IDE will color methods, classes, objects, etc., for readability. The IDE debugs the code in search for errors and then runs the program for the programmer.


## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is top place multiple files into one file so that they are easier to transport, rather than having to attach an abundance of files to an email or upload an abundance of files individually. Also, the compressed file is smaller in comparison to the size of all the files it contains, resulting in space saving and quicker transport.

### Compression and File Size
When Compressing an SVG file that was on my computer, I noticed that the file size before compression was 4.18kb. After the file was compressed, it was 1.10kb. The compressed file was a bout a quarter of its original size.
When compressing a JPG file on my computer, I notice that the file size before compression was 122kb and after compression was 88kb. The file was a third smaller than its original size; however, sometimes JPG files do not experience as much of a shrinkage I data because the file is already compressed.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes:
The attributes of the shark class are swim and be awesome. Attributes describe the object or class and are also known as variables.

### Methods:
The methods of the shark class are print. Methods are commands to the console and in this case are telling the console to print what the writer tells it to.

### Constructor:
The purpose of a constructor method is used to initialize data and it is run as son as an object is instantiated. AKA _init_ method, it will be the first definition of a class

### Class vs. Object
A class stores objects and objects can represent a class. Think of a music library that has different genres or classes of music, and then the song is the object. You call the rock class by selecting song/object, from that genre. This is what instantiating is.

## Object Oriented Concepts
### Instantiated Objects
The instantiated objects in the shark class are Sammy, Stevie, and Matt. An object is an instance of a class. In this case, we took the class Shark and created and instance of it, calling the objects, Sammy, Stevie, and Matt.

### Inheritance
I OOP, multiple classes can be created. The base class, (for sake of example, we can refer to this as the parent class), gives all of its attributes and behaviors to the derived class (for sake of example, we can refer to this as the child class). The child (derived) class inherits the attributes and behaviors from the parent (base) class. An example of inheritance in the shark class is that all three objects are sharks (sammy, stevie, and matt).

### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of using methods and attribute to abstract a real life object when programming. For example, the shark class and objects, are given the methods and attributes swim, because it is what sharks do. 
Encapsulation is hiding what objects can do in methods, as in the shark class, we hid swim, and be awesome in main method. 

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
A UML is a general-purpose diagram that assists in preparing,  organizing  and visualizing the design of a system. 
## Conclusion
There are many different methods and languages to create programs, and many of them can be constructed to complete the same tasks. What all of them have in common is that they follow the SDLC in constructing these programs. Skipping steps in the SDCL could result in faulty programming. It is important to have a plan and keep code organized through a UML when developing a program.
