## Charper 1: What is an Information System
Information systems can be defined in multiple ways. One thing that remains ubiquitous among the 3 definitions of an information system is that is collects, stores and presents useful information to be analyzed by the user. Information systems have 5 components that are a must in order for the informations system to be purposeful. 
Information systems gave businesses the ability to organize information such as financials, productivity, inventory, etc. This became known and manufacturing resource planning. Being more organized and able to analyze information more efficiently, helped the growth of the business. As technology evolved and became easier to obtain, more and more businesses began purchasing computers. This temendously assisted in communication and accessing databases, as businesses began using multiple computers to access the mainframe through client servers and local area networks. Enterprise resource planning became the heart of the business. 1969 was the introduction of the internet and the first long distance transmission of a message. The internet was originally a project by the DOD and only available to universities, government agencies, and researchers. As the internet evolved into the world wide web, businesses gained access and were able to share information internally and to consumers. However, this came with risks and made businesses susceptible to hackers, viruses and other threats. This also began the disintermediation of video stores, magazines, newspapers, and travel agencies, through interacting with websites, blogging, and social networking.

## Information System Components
1.Hardware- Tangible, things you can touch -keyboards, mouse, monitor.

2.Software- Operating systems, programs, apps, etc.

3.Data- Collection of facts such as numbers, words, letters, symbols for future use or analysis.

4.People- The user, analyzer and/or anyone who requests or finds the information useful.

5.Process- The steps taken to achieve a desired outcome such as double clicking or pressing a key.

## GitHub
### Client - Server Architecture
Github is a client server because it is a computer accessible by other computers at a distance. Client servers allow multiple computers to connect to one. GitHub fits this model because it allows us to communicate remotely through main computer/server.
### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing gives users access to applications and data from any computer. An example of this would be google docs. Users upload data to the server and can access it from any computer after logging into the application.
## Conclusion
I found this lab to be challening. GitHub is a great tool and I am interested in becoming more familiar with it. GitHub seems to be a great intoduction into programming. I enjoyed learning about the evolution of the computer, its components and the internet. One fact I found interesting is that the internet was developed by the DOD. I look forward to continuing to learn how computers have changed to world and how computers could be more useful in improving my daily life.
