## Executive Summary 
  Whether it be for business or personal use, the internet has become essential to everyday life. Protocols have been established, implanted, maintained, and frequently upgraded to improve the usability and quality for its billions of users.  The World Wide Web Consortium is a community that works together in developing and enforcing web standards. Transmitting data is an extremely quick process and the internet has simplified the process. But as the internet grew, so did the risks of sending and receiving as well as storing data on the internet.
	HTML is the most common language used to develop web pages along with several other supplemental languages such as XML. HTML focuses on how data looks on a web pages, whereas XML focuses on how data is stored and transported throughout the web page.
	URLs are paths that leads to web pages and data that displays information. They are broken down into several sections beginning with HTTP(S), followed by the scheme, domain name, file path, parameters and then an anchor. File paths can be relative or absolute. Absolute paths include the full domain name and website address, whereas relative paths only point to the file or file path.  Both paths can be used to place data onto a web page, including images of various attributes.


## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
An IP address is a unique number assigned to every device that connects to the internet in order to identify it, kind of like each house has an address. IPv4 is an older version in terms of an IP address. It is a series of 4 numbers between 0 and 225, with each number being separated by a period. Ex: 107.23.196.166. IPv4 was limited to 4 billion people because of lack of possible combinations.
IPv6 is an updated IP address that uses eight groups of four hexadecimal numbers
Ex: 2001:0d68:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334. IPv6 had a limit of 3.4 * 10^38 possible addresses.

#### ICANN
ICANN is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). ICANN assumed the responsibility of distributing IP address blocks to the fiver Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). The RIRs then allocate smaller IP addresses to ISPs (internet service providers) and other network operators, which eventually is assigned to individual users

### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is a network protocol, or set of rules, developed by the DOD, that define the details of how data is sent received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers, and other network communication hardware. TCP/IP collects and reassembles packs of data and sending the packets to the right destination.

#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
The TCP/IP connections work in a manner similar to a phone call where someone initiate the connection by dialing the phone it is attempting to call and someone is at the other end of the line picking up and listening. The client is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in. The client needs to know the phone number (IP address) of the server it wants to connect to and would need to know the port number to reach a particular “extension.”

#### Layers
Protocol suite, which is a collection of protocols that are designed to work together. Protocols can be single layered or stacked. When stacked each level performs a particular function and communicates with the levels above and below it and transmit data to one another. These layers (tasks) are important to changing technology because any particular layer(s) or task(s) can be changed without affecting the other layer.

#### Application Layer
HTTP, E-mail, are examples of applications that run on the “application layer protocol. There are many other similar types of applications that use layer protocol, many of which transfer and receive data, which is what application layering is about, breaking down the process of transferring data, such as the post office does.

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the protocol used for viewing web pages. This is why HTTP is added at the beginning of each web page when trying to retrieve the data. It supports the client server model because every request is sent to a server, the server processes it and outputs a response which in this case is the data of the website.

### Protocols for Secure HTTP
On regular HTTP, data is transferred unencrypted over the internet. This could pose a problem when transferring sensitive data such as personal information, passwords and/or credit card numbers, etc. HTTPS is Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol. HTTPS secures the data sent by http by encrypting the data making it impossible to read by using encryption algorithms.

## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
It is important for one to secure their web browser for a variety of reasons. Securing a web browser protects against spyware, hackers, and individuals attempting to take control of your computer. A secure web browser is helpful in informing the user of potential harmful links and data transfers. 

### Risk Explained
A reason to secure your web browser would be, for example, if a website uses cookies for authentication. If this is the case, an attacker may be able to acquire unauthorized access to the site by obtaining the cookie, potentially accessing confidential information. Persistent cookies are information that websites store on the computer that contain credentials for accessing the site. Session cookies are stored on the computer as well; however, they differ from persistent cookies in that they are deleted when the browser is closed. If someone visits a harmful website from an unsecure browser, the harmful data could be stored on the computer via cookies.

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web (www.). Not only did he develop the World Wide Web, but he also developed a Consortium (World Wide Web Consortium, aka W3C) to devise web standards and led the web to its full potential. The is done through the help of a full-time staff, as well as the users of the World Wide Web. The Web of Devices standard is important because it focuses on making the web accessible, anywhere, anytime, using any device. It is adaptable and changes with the evolution of the web and devices that develop capabilities of accessing the internet. The Web of Devices standard helps users who do not have particular web accessible devices, access the web through devices they do have. For ex. Not everyone has a desktop or laptop computer, but almost everyone has a cell phone which, modernly, has the same capabilities of a laptop or desktop computer.

### HTML5 and CSS
The purpose of HTML5 is to created pages on the World Wide Web that can be read and visited by users. In other words, it is a programming language that creates a presentation on the web. CSS is the language used to style and format HTML documents or webpages. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.
In my attached website example, I wrote brief paragraph in regard to exercising and the importance of finding enjoyable ways to exercise. I formatted the background to a green color, using the hexadecimal number #66ff33. I created a px solid white border around the paragraph and change the heading to white as well. I feel these colors and contrast help maintain the readability of the page.

### HTML and XML
XML does nothing in comparison to HTML. XML focuses on how data is structured, sent, and received, whereas html is focused on how data is displayed on a website. The biggest difference is that XML is not predefine such as HTML is, meaning a writer of XML code can create their own tags, that does nothing more than add information, whereas changing the HTML code will change the format.

## Components of a URL
Scheme - https 
Domain - www.amazon.com 
top level domain - .edu 
default page – no file path provided
parameters - result of search
anchor - specified location on a page

## Conclusion
  The internet has evolved to and essential to everyday life for billions of individuals and businesses; However, ensuring security when using the internet is imperative as there are many risks on faces with being connected to the internet. IP addresses connect people globally and have been improved over the years. 
	Creating a web page is a fairly simple tasks, with a little bit of knowledge, anyone can do. It is important to consider the user when building a web page. Color schemes, image placement, and data placement should be a priority consideration when building a web page.
