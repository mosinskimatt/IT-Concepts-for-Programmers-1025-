## Chapter 2: Hardware 
Hardware is defined as physical components of an information system/computer; however, the definition of hardware is expanding as technology is evolving. Below I have listed components and/or assets that may be vital to an information system/computer.  The brain of a computer is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Commands are delivered to the CPU through input devices and/or software. The CPU processes these commands and delivers them through output devices such as monitors and/or speakers. The speed at which a CPU processes data is Hertz. Some CPUs process Hertz at a rate of one billion per second(gigahertz). Today’s CPUs contain multiple processors (dual core, quad core, 6 core). The three main components of a CPU are the memory unit, the control unit, and the ALU (arithmetic and logic unit). CPUs process commands through seven logic gates. A logic gate receives multiple binary inputs, processes the inputs, and produces one binary output. The CPU is located on the motherboard. The motherboard is the “bus” of the computer. The motherboard is where electrical connections between different components of the computer takes place. Each hardware unit plugs into the motherboard through a port. Modernly, the most common port is the USB port. Volatile hardware is hardware that is only active when the PC is turned on.
Hardware involved in technology is evolving at an astounding rate. Gordon Moore, the founder of intel stated, “the number of transistors on a chip will double every two years for the same price point.” However, the doubling of the speed of chips has maximized and which was noticed by Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia. Huang stated, “the speed of GPUs are increasing faster than Moore’s law. GPUs have become 25x increasingly faster in a matter of five years. This is why technology someone purchases today becomes outdated and deprecates so quickly.
Some people may think of a computer as simply a tower and monitor on a desk or a laptop. However, in the modern era, cell phones, tablets, cars and even TVs appliances can be considered computers. Once connected to the internet, all computers have the ability to transfer data to one another without human involvement. This is called integrated computing and Internet of things (IOT). Computers became a commodity that almost everyone in the world either has or has access to. The price of consumer grade computers has declined significantly, aside from apple. Apple leads the industry because their technology is one of a kind.
With the evolution of the computer and the internet came risks and ethical dilemmas. One risk is data misrepresentation, which could be consequential. Ethically speaking, computers are evolved to benefit humanity. Accidental or intentionally misuse of computers does not benefit the well-being humanity. An Ethically aligned design was developed in order to accurately portray the purpose of computers, how they should be operated, and the effects they should have on humanity.



## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the amount of time it takes for the drive's read/write head to find physical location of data on a disc. Latency is measure in rpm (revolutions per minute). Transfer rate is the rate at which data is transferred. Latency and the data transfer rate are directly correlated. The faster the latency and/or rpms, the faster data can be transferred. 

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Hard drives or HDD (hard disc drive) requires a spinning disc in order to recall memory. This can easily break and or fail for a multitude of reasons. Solid state drives or SDD is flash memory instead of a spinning disc. SDDs are much fast than HDDs at reading and writing data to memory. SDD are known as electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM). Flash drives are also an example of EEPROM.

#### Random Access Memory
RAM is volatile memory that is only accessible while the computer is on. The more ram a computer has, the faster the computer runs, allowing it to do more tasks at one time because it is accessing short term memory stored in the ram. It equates to having a tool belt for quick access, rather than a tool box where you walk to and search for a tool each time you need one. 64 (dimms) bit means that the computer processes 64 bits in one clock cycle and is faster than 32 (simms) bits which only process 32 bits in one cycle.

### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU is the arithmetic and logic unit. It is an essential part of the CPU responsible for mathematics and directing inputs and outputs to RAM. The CU, control unit helps the efficiency of the CPU and directs inputs to the proper part of the computer for processing. The CU directs inputs to the ALU which stores the data for a short period of time in an output register.

#### CPU, Input & Output
The CPU is responsible for processing inputs to outputs. For ex. When you are pumping gas, you input money in one way or another. The CPU’s memory unit remembers your card number or how much money you prepaid until the transaction is complete. The input would be you squeezing the handle and the output would be gas being dispensed into your tank.

### Logic Gates
A truth table shows every possible outcome you could get from an input. The number 1 tells the transistors to turn on and the number 0 tells the transistors to remain off. EX.
The logic gate AND:
Input 1		Input 2		Output
0		      0		      0
1		      0		      0
0		      1		      0
1		      1		      1

The logic gate OR:
Input 1		Input 2		Output
0		      0		      0
1		      0		      1
0		      1		      1
1		      1		      1

The AND gate must consider both inputs of 1 or 0 to give an output of 1. The OR gate output will be 1 if either input is 1. There are seven different logic gates which controls how the transistors on the CPU act and allow “1s” to go through.

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE's is a technical society, and its purpose is to advance technology in a way that benefits humanity. Their main focus is to prevent harmful behavior from autonomous machines. When machines are presented with an ethical dilemma, IEEE is attempting to program machines to choose the more pleasurable outcome.

## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal is base 10 counting. This is what humans use when learning to count on their fingers. This method is converted to binary which is base two counting. Base two or binary converts numbers larger than one, back down to ones and zeros, which is easier to program into computers. Hexadecimal differs in that there are 16 digits that can appear in a single space. Each place value is 16 times larger than the previous.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The representation #ab00ff is a pure (or mostly pure) violet. The hexadecimal color #ab00ff has RGB values of R:171, G:0, B:255 and CMYK values of C:0.33, M:1, Y:0, K:0. Its decimal value is 11206911. This color could be problematic if using it in websites for a variety of reason. For instance, some websites, hyperlinks that have been visited turn a shade of reddish violet and using this color as a background or text could pose accessibility issues. Color contrasting between text and background should be considered when preparing a website for accessibility reasons, especially for people who have an impairment dealing with color differentiation.
## Conclusion
Hardware is perhaps the most essential part of a computer. Hardware determines the speed at which a computer operates, the amount of data that can be stored, and many other factors. If a computer runs slow, I now understand what the potential reasons could be.  The anatomy of a computer appear to be standard and each computer, whether it be a PC, cell phone or a car, contains all of these hardware components and they all process data the same way. The only thing that changes is the software and operating systems. It is almost comparable to human beings. Every person has organs (hardware) necessary for survival, and each organ has a specific job. If one of the organs go bad or fails to do its job, the human (computer) will not work properly and the organ (hardware) will need to be fixed or replace. Like humans, computers can get viruses, which is comparable to getting sick. Viruses can cause computer hardware to not operate properly.
